Last completed: 1

Features:
  1. Create two inputs and a button to get user input.
		The first one is for "item" and the second is for "price".
		Once the button is clicked, the item data should be added to a display list (like the one in todos).
  2. Create a component to display the min and max prices among all items (not for each individual item).
  3. Introduce a third input for "shop" of every item.
  4. Display the min and max price for every item along with the respective shop name.
  5. Limit the possible inputs for items and shops, through config.
  6. Replace both item and shop inputs with select boxes.
	7. Make the items editable.
	8. Filter the items, based on shops. Use a select box as the filter control.
	9. Filter the items, based on product
	10. Make the filters impact the price matrix too.

	11.	Instead of having a separate table to show the max min values, use the table below the inputs and colour the values accordingly.

	12.	Add another property to the items. Named quantity. Just like price. This too is a number.

	13.	In the right pane create two inputs to collect "purchase" details from the user. These inputs are product and quantity. Save the purchases as a separate array in the state.

	14.	Show all purchases in the right panel, below the inputs.

	15.	Allow the user to edit purchases.
